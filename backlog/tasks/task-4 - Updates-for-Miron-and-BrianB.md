## Description
There were a slew of requests from the bosses about ways to improve the daily GPU report. This task consolidates those requests into 7 different AC. Work through each individually so that changes and commits are atomic. 

## Acceptance Criteria
- [X] Move totals to the first row of the table.
- [X] Update the terminology to use "Allocation" instead of "Utilization" (and similar)
- [X] Update the terminology in the different classes: "Prioritized" should be "Prioritized service", "Shared" should be "Open Capacity", and "Backfill" is fine as-is
- [X] Change the order of the tables: "Open Capacity", then "Prioritized service", then "Backfill"
- [X] Right-align the number and percentage columns in the HTML report
- [ ] Significant digits - keep them consistent within a column. (SKIPPED - low priority)
- [X] Add usage percentages to the subject (in the same order)
- [X] Add lookback length to the email subject.
- [X] Separate "Average GPUs" columns into "Allocated" and "Available" columns.
- [X] Add "Methodology" description at the bottom.
- [X] Order device types alphabetically
- [X] Don't include the "Filtering Impact" table
- [X] Fix the TOTAL row in the Cluster Summary table -- GPUs can be double-counted (in both the Prioritized and Shared lists). Make sure these are only counted once in the TOTAL.

## Implementation Notes

### Approach taken
Working through each acceptance criteria atomically as requested. For each AC, I identify the affected code sections, make targeted changes, and test the modifications before moving to the next criterion.

### Features implemented or modified
1. **Table totals positioning**: Modified the `generate_html_report` function to calculate totals first and render them as the first row after headers.

2. **Terminology standardization**: Updated all user-facing text from "Utilization" to "Allocation" and class names from "Prioritized/Shared/Backfill" to "Prioritized service/Open Capacity/Backfill".

3. **Table ordering**: Reordered tables to display "Open Capacity", then "Prioritized service", then "Backfill".

4. **Column alignment**: Right-aligned all number and percentage columns in HTML reports using inline CSS styles.

5. **Email subject enhancements**: Added usage percentages and lookback periods to email subjects with smart formatting (24h, 2d, 3w, etc.).

6. **Column separation**: Split "Average GPUs" into separate "Allocated (avg.)" and "Available (avg.)" columns with clear headers.

7. **Methodology section**: Created external `methodology.md` file with markdown-to-HTML conversion and added it to report footer.

8. **Alphabetical sorting**: Implemented alphabetical ordering of device types across all tables and displays.

9. **Filtering Impact table removal**: Removed the Filtering Impact table from reports while preserving the underlying exclusion functionality.

10. **Double-counting fix**: Implemented `calculate_unique_cluster_totals_from_raw_data()` function to ensure TOTAL row counts each physical GPU only once, preventing double-counting between Priority and Backfill categories.

### Technical decisions and trade-offs
- Preserved internal variable names to maintain code consistency while updating display terminology
- Used external markdown file for methodology to enable easy updates without code changes
- Implemented smart time period formatting for email subjects (hours for â‰¤24h, days for >24h)
- Created comprehensive deduplication logic that works with raw DataFrame data to properly handle GPU overlap between categories
- Only skipped the significant digits AC as it was marked low priority

### Modified files
- `/Users/iross/projects/gpu_health_monitoring/usage_stats.py`: Extensive modifications for all acceptance criteria
- `/Users/iross/projects/gpu_health_monitoring/templates/gpu_report.html`: Updated terminology and column headers
- `/Users/iross/projects/gpu_health_monitoring/methodology.md`: New external methodology documentation
