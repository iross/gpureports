## Description

The codebase has accumulated technical debt with duplicate functions, inconsistent naming, scattered analysis scripts, and unclear separation of concerns. This task involves refactoring to improve maintainability, reduce duplication, and establish clear code organization patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove duplicate functions across analyze.py and usage_stats.py
- [ ] Consolidate scattered analysis scripts into organized modules
- [ ] Establish consistent naming conventions throughout codebase
- [ ] Create clear separation between data collection and analysis logic
- [ ] Improve code documentation and type hints
- [ ] Remove unused or obsolete code files
- [ ] Establish consistent error handling patterns

## Implementation Plan

1. Audit all Python files to identify duplicate functions and consolidation opportunities\n2. Create a unified utilities module for common GPU filtering and counting functions\n3. Reorganize scattered debug and analysis scripts into logical directories\n4. Standardize function naming conventions (snake_case) and variable names\n5. Add comprehensive type hints and docstrings to all functions\n6. Remove obsolete files and unused imports\n7. Establish consistent error handling and logging patterns\n8. Create clear module boundaries between data collection, processing, and reporting\n9. Update import statements to reflect new organization\n10. Run tests to ensure refactoring doesn't break functionality

## Implementation Notes

Successfully refactored and cleaned up the codebase with the following improvements:

**Code Organization:**
- Created gpu_utils.py module consolidating duplicate functions from analyze.py and usage_stats.py
- Organized scripts into logical directories: debug/, scripts/, analysis/, tests/
- Removed temporary and obsolete files

**Duplicate Function Removal:**
- Consolidated filter_df, count_backfill, count_shared, count_prioritized functions
- Unified load_host_exclusions, get_display_name, get_required_databases functions
- Updated all import statements to use the new utilities module

**Directory Structure:**
- debug/ - debugging and diagnostic scripts
- scripts/ - plotting and utility scripts  
- analysis/ - analysis notebooks and specialized scripts
- tests/ - unit tests with updated import paths
- templates/ - HTML report templates

**Documentation:**
- Created comprehensive README.md explaining project structure
- Added proper docstrings and type hints to gpu_utils.py
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing functionality

**Testing:**
- Verified imports work correctly after refactoring
- Updated test files to work with new directory structure
- Confirmed core functionality remains intact

The codebase is now more maintainable with clear separation of concerns, reduced duplication, and better organization.
