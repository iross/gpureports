## Description
- `usage_stats.py` has become an enormous file, and it can likely benefit from a re-visit and some refactoring.  This probably dovetails (or overlaps entirely) task 20's cleanup focus, but that was more used for the performance improvements. This task focuses on refactoring the code to improve readability and maintainability.
