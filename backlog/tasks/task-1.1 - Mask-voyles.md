## Description
voyles2000.chtc.wisc.edu is a prioritized host, but not via the usual
"PrioritizedProjects" approach. We should exclude these GPUs from the reporting,
since they are unable to be utilized in the fair share setting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GPUs from voyles2000.chtc.wisc.edu are not included in the reporting for the
"Shared" GPU class.
