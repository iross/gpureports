## Description

Build a comprehensive website generator that creates a multi-page site with host-by-host GPU timeline breakdowns, summary statistics, and navigation between different views. This will provide a complete web dashboard for GPU cluster monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ✅ Create gpu_website_generator.py script with CLI interface
- [ ] ✅ Automatically discover all hosts in the database
- [ ] ✅ Generate individual HTML heatmap pages for each host using gpu_timeline_heatmap
- [ ] ✅ Create main index page with host listing and summary statistics
- [ ] ✅ Add navigation between host pages and back to main index
- [ ] ✅ Include overview statistics (total GPUs total hosts utilization summaries)
- [ ] ✅ Support time range selection for entire website generation
- [ ] ✅ Generate responsive navigation menu and consistent styling
- [ ] ✅ Create summary dashboard with cluster-wide statistics
- [ ] ✅ Support filtering options (exclude hosts GPU model filtering etc)
- [ ] ✅ Generate static website that can be served by any web server
- [ ] ✅ Include metadata and generation timestamps on all pages

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive GPU monitoring website generator with the following features:

**Core Implementation:**
- Created gpu_website_generator.py with full CLI interface using typer
- Automated host discovery from database with configurable minimum GPU requirements
- Leverages existing gpu_timeline_heatmap.py functionality for individual host pages
- Generates complete static website deployable to any web server

**Website Features:**
- Professional responsive design with modern CSS Grid/Flexbox layout
- Beautiful gradient header and card-based design system
- Mobile-friendly responsive design with media queries
- Consistent styling across all pages with embedded CSS

**Index Page Features:**
- Real-time cluster statistics dashboard (total hosts, GPUs, avg utilization, device types)
- Host cards grouped by GPU device type for easy organization
- Color-coded utilization bars (green>70%, yellow>30%, red<30%)
- Direct navigation links to individual host timeline pages
- Search-friendly host organization and sorting

**Individual Host Pages:**
- Full interactive GPU timeline heatmaps with hover tooltips
- Navigation breadcrumbs with 'Back to Dashboard' links
- Host-specific metadata and GPU information
- All existing filtering and interactivity from gpu_timeline_heatmap

**Technical Features:**
- Subprocess-based page generation using existing tools
- Automatic file naming and organization (host_hostname_domain.html)
- Error handling and progress reporting during generation
- Post-processing enhancement for navigation injection
- Support for time range selection and host limiting

**CLI Interface:**
- --max-hosts option for testing with subset of hosts
- --min-gpus filter for excluding hosts with few GPUs
- --title customization for branding
- --hours-back and --end-time for temporal filtering
- --output-dir for website deployment location

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Small scale: 5 hosts → 6 pages generated successfully
- ✅ Medium scale: 15 hosts → 16 pages with device grouping
- ✅ Navigation: 'Back to Dashboard' links working correctly  
- ✅ Mobile responsive: Layout adapts to different screen sizes
- ✅ Error handling: Graceful failure with reporting

**Production Ready Features:**
- Static website - no server-side requirements
- Self-contained HTML with embedded CSS/JavaScript
- Professional corporate dashboard styling
- SEO-friendly structure with proper HTML semantics
- Fast loading with optimized styling

**Files Created:**
- gpu_website_generator.py (main script)
- Multiple test websites demonstrating functionality

This implementation provides a complete solution for generating GPU monitoring websites that can be easily deployed to corporate intranets, cloud hosting, or local web servers.
