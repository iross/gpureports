## Description
Do a full analysis of the codebase and identify any unused or unnecessary files, directories, or code snippets. Remove them to keep the project clean and organized.
Also do an analysis of performance. The weekly report takes around 15 minutes to run on a remote machine, which seems excessively long. Profile bottlenecks and optimize.
Ensure that the changes do not introduce any regressions or changes to the reports.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Remove unnecessary files and directories,Optimize database queries and data processing,Profile performance bottlenecks,Reduce weekly report runtime to under 5 minutes,Ensure no regressions in report accuracy,Document performance improvements
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Conduct codebase audit to identify cleanup opportunities
   - Remove unused CSV files, logs, and temporary files
   - Remove unused Python scripts and debug files
   - Clean up empty or redundant directories
   - Remove old database files that are no longer needed

2. Profile performance bottlenecks in usage_stats.py
   - Add timing measurements to key functions
   - Identify slow database queries
   - Analyze memory usage patterns
   - Test with different time ranges (1h, 24h, weekly)

3. Implement performance optimizations
   - Optimize SQL queries and add indexes if needed
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Implement data chunking for large datasets
   - Optimize pandas operations and memory usage
   - Consider parallel processing for independent calculations

4. Validate optimizations
   - Ensure report accuracy is maintained
   - Run regression tests comparing old vs new outputs
   - Measure performance improvements
   - Test edge cases and error handling

5. Documentation and cleanup
   - Document performance improvements achieved
   - Update README with cleanup recommendations
   - Add performance monitoring guidelines
