## Description
Do a full analysis of the codebase and identify any unused or unnecessary files, directories, or code snippets. Remove them to keep the project clean and organized.
Also do an analysis of performance. The weekly report takes around 15 minutes to run on a remote machine, which seems excessively long. Profile bottlenecks and optimize.
Ensure that the changes do not introduce any regressions or changes to the reports.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Remove unnecessary files and directories,Optimize database queries and data processing,Profile performance bottlenecks,Reduce weekly report runtime to under 5 minutes,Ensure no regressions in report accuracy,Document performance improvements
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Conduct codebase audit to identify cleanup opportunities. Identify, but do not delete:
   - unused CSV files, logs, and temporary files
   - unused Python scripts and debug files
   - empty or redundant directories
   - old database files that are no longer needed

2. Profile performance bottlenecks in usage_stats.py
   - Add timing measurements to key functions
   - Identify slow database queries
   - Analyze memory usage patterns
   - Test with different time ranges (1h, 24h, weekly)

3. Implement performance optimizations
   - Optimize SQL queries and add indexes if needed
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Implement data chunking for large datasets
   - Optimize pandas operations and memory usage
   - Consider parallel processing for independent calculations

4. Validate optimizations
   - Ensure report accuracy is maintained
   - Run regression tests comparing old vs new outputs
   - Measure performance improvements
   - Test edge cases and error handling

5. Documentation and cleanup
   - Document performance improvements achieved with before/after comparisons
   - Update README with cleanup recommendations
   - Add performance monitoring guidelines

## Implementation Notes

## Analysis Completed

### Cleanup Analysis
- **Total project size**: 1.9GB identified 
- **Cleanup opportunities**: ~95MB of removable files (CSV files, logs, debug scripts, temp files)
- **Database files**: 1.6GB of current operational data (keep)
- **Detailed breakdown**: See CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md

### Performance Analysis  
- **Current performance**: 24-hour analysis = 25.3s (weekly ~15 min on remote)
- **Key bottlenecks identified**:
  1. Database operations: 8.86s (35%) - Single-threaded queries, memory inefficient
  2. Device allocation calc: 6.79s (27%) - Inefficient DataFrame filtering  
  3. String operations: 5.17s (20%) - Excessive regex matching
  4. Memory allocation calc: 2.07s (8%) - Similar to device allocation issues

### Optimization Targets
- **Conservative**: 50% improvement → 7.5 min weekly
- **Aggressive**: 75% improvement → 3.8 min weekly ✅ Under 5-min goal

### Implementation Priority
1. Database query optimization (60% of potential gains)
2. DataFrame operation caching (25% of potential gains) 
3. Parallel processing (15% of potential gains)

**Files created**: CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md, PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md, profile_usage_stats.py

## Phase 3 Implementation COMPLETED

### Memory Allocation Optimization Results  
- Applied pre-filtering optimization to calculate_allocation_usage_by_memory()
- Eliminated triple-nested filter operations (memory categories × buckets × classes)
- Pre-computed filtered datasets by memory category and slot class combination
- Performance improvements achieved:
  - 24-hour analysis: 13.03s → 8.18s (+37.2%)
  - Processing rate: 11,856 → 18,891 rec/s (+59.3%)
  - Function calls: 27.7M → 10.9M (-60.6%)  
  - filter_df_enhanced calls: 1,503 → 63 (-95.8%)

### FINAL CUMULATIVE PERFORMANCE vs BASELINE
- 24-hour analysis: ~25.3s → 8.18s (+67.7% TOTAL IMPROVEMENT)
- Processing rate: 6,407 → 18,891 rec/s (2.95x faster)
- Function calls: ~58M → 10.9M (-82% total reduction) 
- filter_df_enhanced calls: 5,535 → 63 (-98.9% total reduction)
- Remote weekly projection: 15min → 6.8min (86% of way to <5min goal)

### All Phase Changes Made
**Phase 1**: Database query optimization with SQL filtering and indexes
**Phase 2**: DataFrame caching and filtering optimization with pre-computed datasets  
**Phase 3**: Memory allocation processing optimization with eliminated nested filtering

Files created: CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md, PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md, profile_usage_stats.py, PHASE1_OPTIMIZATION_RESULTS.md, PHASE2_OPTIMIZATION_RESULTS.md, PHASE3_OPTIMIZATION_RESULTS.md

Status: EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE GAINS ACHIEVED - 67.7% total improvement, very close to <5min weekly goal

## Phase 2 Implementation COMPLETED

### DataFrame Caching and Filtering Optimization Results
- Advanced DataFrame preprocessing cache with unified cache keys
- Filtered dataset caching to eliminate redundant filter operations  
- Pre-computed filtered datasets by utilization type and device type
- Performance improvements achieved:
  - 24-hour analysis: 22.34s → 13.03s (+41.7%)
  - Processing rate: 6,914 → 11,856 rec/s (+71.5%) 
  - Function calls: 58.2M → 27.7M (-52.4%)
  - filter_df_enhanced calls: 5,535 → 1,503 (-72.8%)

### Cumulative Performance vs Baseline  
- 24-hour analysis: ~25.3s → 13.03s (+48.5% total improvement)
- Weekly estimate: ~177s → ~91s (+48.5% total improvement)
- Remote weekly projection: 15min → ~7.6min (need Phase 3 for <5min goal)

### Changes Made
1. Enhanced get_preprocessed_dataframe() with conditional processing
2. Added get_cached_filtered_dataframe() for filter-specific caching
3. Pre-compute filtered datasets once per utilization/device combination
4. Eliminated redundant filter_df_enhanced calls in inner loops
